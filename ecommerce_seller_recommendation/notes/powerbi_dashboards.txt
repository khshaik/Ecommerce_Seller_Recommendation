⭐ STEP 1 — Install Power BI (on Mac)

Because Power BI Desktop is Windows-only, do ONE of the following:

OPTION A (Recommended) — Use Power BI Service (online version)

No installation needed:
👉 https://app.powerbi.com/

OPTION B — Use Windows VM

Install Power BI Desktop via:
Parallels Desktop or VirtualBox + Windows ISO

The assignment acceptance normally allows Power BI Service, so use that.

⭐ STEP 2 — Prepare your dataset

From your Jupyter notebooks:

Open HP_Preprocessing.ipynb

Locate the final cleaned dataframe (before splitting)

Export to CSV:

df.to_csv("clean_data.csv", index=False)


Upload clean_data.csv to Power BI

⭐ STEP 3 — Load data into Power BI
In Power BI Service:

Click Create → Upload a file → CSV

Load the clean_data.csv

⭐ STEP 4 — Create slicers (interactive dropdowns)

Add the following slicers:

✔ City (multi-select)
✔ Bedrooms (BHK)
✔ Property Type
✔ Availability

These will make your dashboard interactive.

⭐ STEP 5 — Create visuals (one by one)
📊 Visual 1: Avg Price by City

Insert → Bar Chart

Assign fields:

X-axis → City

Y-axis → Average of Price

📊 Visual 2: Bedroom Count per City

Insert → Clustered Column Chart

Fields:

Axis → City

Legend → BHK

Values → Count of rows

📊 Visual 3: Price vs Area Scatter Plot

Insert → Scatter Chart

Fields:

X → Area

Y → Price

Details → City

Add slicers to filter by BHK.

📊 Visual 4: Property Type Distribution

Insert → Donut Chart

Fields:

Legend → Property Type

Values → Count of rows

📊 Visual 5: Drill-down button

Insert → Buttons → Navigator → Page Navigator
Make Page 2 your “City drill-down”.

On Page 2:

Add visual: Avg Price by BHK

Add visual: Avg Price by Property Type

Add visual: Availability Pie Chart

⭐ STEP 6 — Format the dashboard (professional theme)

Apply Power BI theme: “Professional” or “Blue Dust”

Align visuals using Format → Align

Add Titles (e.g., “City-Level Housing Insights”)

⭐ STEP 7 — Publish / Export

Your final submission can include:

✔ PBIX or PowerBI Service .pdf export
✔ Screenshots (3–5 key plots)
✔ Notebook output visuals (matplotlib/seaborn)
